            <h1>Event FAQs</h1>

            <h3>Are events open to the public?</h3>
            <p>Yes! 801 Labs is a community based hackerspace that was setup to provide a place for the community of Salt Lake City to meet about technology and host events. All of our events are open to the public.</p>

            <h3>Are events free?</h3>
            <p>All of our events are open to the public, most are free, some are paid.  We always accept and encourage donations.  Some classes may charge a fee to cover material costs, if stated on the event’s meetup page.  There will often be an option to attend the class and bring your own materials or just observing the class without building something.  Contact the presenter on our Slack channel if you have questions.</p>

            <h3>I can’t make or I missed an event, are they recorded?</h3>
            <p>Yes! Most of our classes are archived on our youtube channel. Upon request a live stream may be possible, contact the presenter on our Slack channel for details.</p>

            <h3>Do I need a membership?</h3>
            <p>No, there is no membership.  However we do accept and encourage donations!  801 Labs is a community based hackerspace that was setup to provide a place for the community of Salt Lake City to meet about technology and host events.</p>

            </a>

            <h3>Do I need to donate or have a membership to participate?</h3>
            <p>No! The space is open to the public and run entirely by volunteers. Our operating costs are covered entirely by voluntary donations and recurring patronage, but no activities or responsibilities at the space are contingent upon receipt of donations. If you’d like to attend events or get involved around the space, you are encouraged to do so.</p>

            <h3>I would like to request a topic be covered in a class, what should I do?</h3>
            <p>We’ve got a form on our get involved page for just this occasion. If you let us know what you’re looking for, we can ask among the community if there is anyone who would like to teach a class on a specific topic. If there is interest in a topic, we will do our best to find someone qualified to teach about it, but we may not be able to make every request into a class.</p>
