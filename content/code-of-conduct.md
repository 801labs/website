# 801 Labs Code of Conduct  [ DRAFT - not yet in effect ]

This document details the policies and procedures of 801 Labs, approved by the Board of Directors on the recorded date. This version of the Policies replaces any previously-dated Policies.

Updates to these Policies can be made by majority vote of the Board at any Board meeting.

## Safety & Compliance
**For any emergencies, always call 9-1-1**

The Key Holding Officers shall ensure 801 Labs's compliance with all fire codes, health codes, and relevant safety laws at all times.

It is the responsibility of all persons in the space to provide safe working conditions to every other person in the space at all times. Particularly, any two members can ask another person to stop doing something that makes them feel unsafe, regardless of what it is. Any conflicts that arise should be brought to the attention of a Key Holding Officer or Board mber.

Each particular piece of equipment to be found in 801 Labs has its own safety procedures that are required to know before using the equipment. No individual is allowed to use any equipment for which he/she is not trained and approved to operate.

Each person is responsible for any damage caused to the space or equipment, beyond normal wear and tear.

801 Labs is not responsible for lost or stolen property of any Patron or any guest.

## Behavior & Discipline Policy

### Conflict Resolution
Given that we are not in a perfect world, conflict will occasionally occur. Any Key Holding Officer can be called upon to address a conflict between two or more individuals. Conflicts between an Officer and any other party is to be resolved by a Board Member. The Key Holding Officer or Board Member's decision is binding until the next board meeting, at which point the stakeholders have the opportunity to appeal to the Board. If no appeal is made, the previously made decision stands. Otherwise the majority vote of the Board regarding the appeal is binding.

### Disciplinary Process
801 Labs reserves the right to terminate any patronage at any time for any reason, but we strive for the process to be as fair and open as privacy and discretion allow us to be. The disciplinary process against a individual can involve one or more of the following steps:

1. The Patron will get a verbal warning from a Key Holding Officer or a Board Member
2. The Patron will receive a formal Warning, signed by a Board Member or Key Holding Officer
3. The Patron will be called before the Board to discuss the behavior in question.
4. The Patron will be put on probation.
5. Patron will be suspended for a length of time.
6. The Patron will be permanently banned from the space.

Minor conflicts would begin with a verbal warning and only proceed further as necessary. For offenses that affect safety or affects security of the space, any Key Holding Officer or Board Member have the ability to immediately suspend a Patron or guest, prohibiting access to the space. Upon this action, the Officer or Board Member must notify the Board of the suspension. This suspension is in effect until the next board meeting, at which time the suspension automatically ends unless the Board votes otherwise.

Note that some offenses – including but not limited to non-payment of dues – can trigger automatic patronage suspension or termination, without a formal review by the Board or any other steps listed above. Please note, 801 Labs does not currently accept dues.

## Minors (<18 yrs old) and Animals
Minors and animals are welcome at 801 Labs, but must be accompanied by a guardian who is at least 18 years old. The guardian is responsible for:
