# 801 Labs Code of Conduct

This document details the policies and procedures of 801 Labs, approved by the Board of Directors on the recorded date. This version of the Policies replaces any previously-dated Policies.

Updates to these Policies can be made by majority vote of the Board at any Board meeting.

## Safety & Compliance
**For any emergencies, always call 9-1-1**

The Key Holding Volunteers shall ensure 801 Labs's compliance with all fire codes, health codes, and relevant safety laws at all times.

It is the responsibility of all persons in the space to provide safe working conditions to every other person in the space at all times. Particularly, any two members can ask another person to stop doing something that makes them feel unsafe, regardless of what it is. Any conflicts that arise should be brought to the attention of a Key Holding Volunteer or Board member.

Each particular piece of equipment to be found in 801 Labs has its own safety procedures that are required to know before using the equipment. No Member is allowed to use any equipment for which he/she is not trained and approved to operate.

Each person is responsible for any damage caused to the space or equipment, beyond normal wear and tear.

801 Labs is not responsible for lost or stolen property of the Patron or any guest.

## Key Holding Volunteers
801 Labs's board appoints – by majority vote – key holding volunteers who make the day-to-day decisions between board meetings. All keyholding volunteers are expected to look out for the best interests of the hackerspace, including following and enforcement of this code of conduct. Each Key Holding Volunteer has primary authority over a specific domain, though Key Holding Volunteers occasionally share tasks between domains:

**Volunteer Coordinator** 

* Coordinates all business-related activities of the space
* Represents 801 Labs to external organizations
* Submits budgets for approval and supervises spending
* Works with the Board to draft policy, and oversee the implementation of approved policies

**Operations Manager** 

* Directs the day-to-day operations of the space
* Oversees tools and equipment, infrastructure, classes

**Safety Officer** 

* While safety is the responsibility of every volunteer, this role is the oversight of safety at the hackerspace
* Ensures equipment and patrons operating said equipment are doing so in a safe and controlled manner
* Resolve issues between patrons, up to and including violations of this Code of Conduct and enforcement of the disciplinary process.

It is not required to be a member of the Board to be a Key Holding Volunteer, though it is required that a Key Holding Volunteer be a Member in good standing. The Key Holding Volunteers may from time to time join the Board in Executive Session.

## Equipment Use Policy
801Labs provides free internet access on site for individuals who are present at the hackerspace. This internet connection is to be used in accordance with all local, state, and federal laws, and may not be used to conduct any of the following:

* Download or upload obscene, offensive or illegal material.
* Send confidential information to unauthorized recipients.
* Invade another person’s privacy and gain access to sensitive information.
* Download or upload pirated movies, music, material or software.
* Visit potentially dangerous websites that can compromise our network and computers’ safety.
* Perform unauthorized or illegal actions, like hacking, fraud or buying/selling illegal goods.

Usage of a VPN (Virtual Private Network) service for personal data security is encouraged.

801Labs provides access to tools and resources located and owned by the hackerspace. You must be a Patron in good standing to operate 801 Labs tools or equipment, as well as trained and approved to operate each piece of equipment. Do not use tools for which you are not certified. If you wish to be educated and certified in the usage of the tools, please talk to a Keyholding volunteer, and they will point you in the right direction.

## Privacy Policy
In this Policy, "Personal Data" refers to information such as name, address, phone number, or other data that could be used to identify him or her. 801 Labs shall always take steps to reasonably secure Patreons' Personal Data. A Patron has the right, upon request, to review and update any Personal Data stored by 801 Labs.

801 Labs does not share Personal Data with third-party organizations for any marketing-related purpose. 801 Labs will only use members' Personal Data as it relates to providing the benefits of patronage, one example could be entering the Patron's Name into the Landlord's security system for the purpose of activating the Patron's access card.

## Behavior & Discipline Policy

### Conflict Resolution
Given that we are not in a perfect world, conflict will occasionally occur. Any Key Holding Volunteer can be called upon to address a conflict between two or more members. The Key Holding Volunteer's decision is binding until the next board meeting, at which point the stakeholders have the opportunity to appeal to the Board. If no appeal is made, the Key Holding Volunteer's decision stands. Otherwise the majority vote of the Board regarding the appeal is binding.

### Disciplinary Process
801 Labs reserves the right to terminate any patronage at any time for any reason, but we strive for the process to be as fair and open as privacy and discretion allow us to be. The disciplinary process against a Patron can involve one or more of the following steps:

1. The Patron will get a verbal warning from a Key Holding Volunteer or a Board member.
2. The Patron will receive a formal Warning, via letter or email, signed by a Board member or Key Holding Volunteer.
3. The Patron will be called before the Board to discuss the behavior in question.
4. The Patron will be put on probation.
5. Patron will be suspended for a length of time.
6. Patron access will be terminated.
7. The Patron will be permanently banned from the space.

Minor conflicts would begin with a verbal warning and only proceed further as necessary. For offenses that affect the safety or security of the space, a Key Holding Volunteer has the ability to immediately suspend a membership, prohibiting the Member access to the space. This suspension is in effect until the next board meeting, at which time the suspension automatically ends unless the Board votes otherwise.

Note that some offenses – including but not limited to non-payment of dues – can trigger automatic patronage suspension or termination, without a formal review by the Board or any other steps listed above.

## Children (<18 yrs old) and Animals
Children and animals are welcome at 801 Labs, but must be accompanied by a guardian.  The guardian is responsible for:

1. The child/animal's actions and messes.
2. The child/animal's health.  It should go without saying, but please do not bring illness into a confined public place.
3. The child/animal's forced interactions with other 801 Labs Patrons who are not comfortable around children/animals.
4. The child/animal's dismissal from the hackerspace in the event of persistent problems.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting


## Signatures

### Board President

* Signs for equipment checked in or out, such as for fairs/conventions
* Signs for anything shipped to/from the space

## Organization-Owned Equipment
This section refers specifically to a piece of equipment – such as a laser cutter, 3D printer, leather-stitcher (i.e. something more than just tools) – that a Patron wishes to locate in the space and share with the community. The guidelines of this arrangement are below:

1. The agreement must be approved by the board in advance of its move to the space
2. The equipment must be formally leased to 801 Labs
3. The agreement must contain the owner's guidelines for training and allowed the use of the equipment
4. The agreement must contain a time period, or specify the terms of the equipment's removal
5. Anything left at the space for more than 24 hours without following this is considered an anonymous donation to the nonprofit.  At which point 801 Labs may dispose or use it.

## Non-Profit Status
801 Labs does not exist to subsidize for-profit ventures. As an Organization organized for exclusively religious, charitable, educational and scientific purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, 801 Labs **prohibits** any for-profit business or operations at the hackerspace, as well as any political campaigning or related activities.
