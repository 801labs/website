      <p class="c15 c20"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c10"><span class="c1">This document details the policies and procedures of 801 Labs, approved by the Board of Directors on the recorded date. This version of the Policies replaces any previously-dated Policies.</span></p>
      <p class="c9"><span class="c1">Updates to these Policies can be made by majority vote of the Board at any Board meeting.</span></p>
      <h2 class="c14" id="h.t4rlo5r6j5p1"><span class="c3">Safety &amp; Compliance</span></h2>
      <p class="c10"><span class="c11">For any emergencies, always call 9-1-1</span></p>
      <p class="c9"><span class="c1">The Key Holding Volunteers shall ensure 801 Labs&rsquo;s compliance with all fire codes, health codes, and relevant safety laws at all times.</span></p>
      <p class="c9"><span class="c1">It is the responsibility of all persons in the space to provide safe working conditions to every other person in the space at all times. Particularly, any two members can ask another person to stop doing something that makes them feel unsafe, regardless of what it is. Any conflicts that arise should be brought to the attention of a Key Holding Volunteer or Board member.</span></p>
      <p class="c9"><span class="c1">Each particular piece of equipment to be found in 801 Labs has its own safety procedures that are required to know before using the equipment. No Member is allowed to use any equipment for which he/she is not trained and approved to operate.</span></p>
      <p class="c9"><span class="c1">Each person is responsible for any damage caused to the space or equipment, beyond normal wear and tear.</span></p>
      <p class="c9"><span>801 Labs is not responsible </span><span>for lost</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;or stolen property of the Member or any guest.</span></p>
      <h2 class="c14" id="h.t3v1utseo31t"><span class="c12 c19">Key Holding Volunteers</span></h2>
      <p class="c9"><span class="c1">801 Labs&rsquo;s board appoints &ndash; by majority vote &ndash; key holding volunteers who make the day-to-day decisions between board meetings. Each Key Holding Volunteer has primary authority over a specific domain, though Key Holding Volunteers occasionally share tasks between domains:</span></p>
      <p class="c9"><span class="c12">Volunteer Coordinator</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ndash; &ldquo;Director of External Affairs&rdquo;</span></p>
      <ul class="c7 lst-kix_jsv5jrp2dkba-0 start">

      </ul>
      <p class="c9"><span class="c12">Operations Manager</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ndash; &ldquo;Director of Internal Affairs&rdquo;</span></p>
      <ul class="c7 lst-kix_jq58wx1gfj39-0 start">
         <li class="c4"><span class="c1">Directs the day-to-day operations of the space</span></li>
         <li class="c4"><span class="c1">Oversees tools and equipment, infrastructure, classes</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="c9"><span class="c12">Treasurer</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ndash; &ldquo;Director of the Money&rdquo;</span></p>
      <ul class="c7 lst-kix_dfpavs29h7k5-0 start">
         <li class="c4"><span class="c1">Pays expenses</span></li>
         <li class="c4"><span class="c1">Manages the financial accounts of the space</span></li>
         <li class="c4"><span class="c1">Tracks and reports on donations and financial data</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="c9"><span>It is not required to be a member of the Board to be a Key Holding Volunteer, though it is required that a Key Holding Volunteer be a Member in good standing. The Key Holding Volunteers may from time to time join the Board in Executive Session.</span></p>
      <h2 class="c14" id="h.uzoq5c5zhgt"><span class="c3">Equipment Use Policy</span></h2>
      <p class="c9"><span class="c1">You must be a member in good standing to operate 801 Labs tools or equipment. Do not use tools for which you are not certified.</span></p>
      <h2 class="c14" id="h.dan8exm6p9y1"><span class="c3">Privacy Policy</span></h2>
      <p class="c9"><span class="c1">In this Policy, &ldquo;Personal Data&rdquo; refers to information such as a member&rsquo;s name, address, phone number, or other data that could be used to identify him or her. 801 Labs shall always take steps to reasonably secure Members&rsquo; Personal Data. A Member has the right, upon request, to review and update any Personal Data stored by 801 Labs.</span></p>
      <p class="c9"><span class="c1">801 Labs does not share Personal Data with third-party organizations for any marketing-related purpose. 801 Labs will only use members&rsquo; Personal Data as it relates to providing the benefits of membership, one example of which is entering the Member&rsquo;s Name into the Landlord&rsquo;s security system for the purpose of activating the member&rsquo;s access card.</span></p>
      <h2 class="c14" id="h.wg11rwavdzln"><span class="c3">Behavior &amp; Discipline Policy</span></h2>
      <h3 class="c6" id="h.usflgdn3070m"><span class="c5">Conflict Resolution</span></h3>
      <p class="c9"><span class="c1">Given that we are not in a perfect world, conflict will occasionally occur. Any Key Holding Volunteer can be called upon to address a conflict between two or more members. The Key Holding Volunteer&rsquo;s decision is binding until the next board meeting, at which point the stakeholders have the opportunity to appeal to the Board. If no appeal is made, the Key Holding Volunteer&rsquo;s decision stands. Otherwise the majority vote of the Board regarding the appeal is binding.</span></p>
      <h3 class="c6" id="h.dh2wq2doi74c"><span class="c5">Disciplinary Process</span></h3>
      <p class="c9"><span>801 Labs</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;reserves the right to terminate any membership at any time for any reason, but we strive for the process to be as fair and open as privacy and discretion allow us to be. The disciplinary process against a member can involve one or more of the following steps:</span></p>
      <ol class="c7 lst-kix_al2nrvthpc3k-0 start" start="1">
         <li class="c4"><span class="c1">The Patron will get a verbal warning from a Key Holding Volunteer or a Board member.</span></li>
         <li class="c4"><span class="c1">The Patron will receive a formal Warning, via letter or email, signed by a Board member or Key Holding Volunteer.</span></li>
         <li class="c4"><span class="c1">The Patron will be called before the Board to discuss the behavior in question.</span></li>
         <li class="c4"><span class="c1">The Patron will be put on probation.</span></li>
         <li class="c4"><span class="c1">Patron will be suspended for a length of time.</span></li>
         <li class="c4"><span class="c1">Patron access will be terminated.</span></li>
         <li class="c4"><span class="c1">The Patron will be permanently banned from the space.</span></li>
      </ol>
      <p class="c9"><span class="c1">Minor conflicts would begin with a verbal warning and only proceed further as necessary. For offenses that affect the safety or security of the space, a Key Holding Volunteer has the ability to immediately suspend a membership, prohibiting the Member access to the space. This suspension is in effect until the next board meeting, at which time the suspension automatically ends unless the Board votes otherwise.</span></p>
      <p class="c9"><span class="c1">Note that some offenses &ndash; including but not limited to non-payment of dues &ndash; can trigger automatic membership suspension or termination, without a formal review by the Board or any other steps listed above.</span></p>
      <h1 class="c9 c17" id="h.xcd8haq4d95k"><span class="c18">Children (&lt;18 yrs old) and Animals</span></h1>
      <p class="c15"><span class="c1">Children and animals are welcome at 801 Labs, but must be accompanied by a guardian. &nbsp;The guardian is responsible for:</span></p>
      <ol class="c7 lst-kix_nthhqkobj5sz-0 start" start="1">
         <li class="c15 c16"><span class="c1">The child/animal&rsquo;s actions and messes.</span></li>
         <li class="c15 c16"><span class="c1">The child/animal&rsquo;s health. &nbsp;It should go without saying, but please do not bring illness into a confined public place.</span></li>
         <li class="c15 c16"><span class="c1">The child/animal&rsquo;s forced interactions with other 801 Labs Patrons who are not comfortable around children/animals. &nbsp;</span></li>
         <li class="c15 c16"><span>The child/animal&rsquo;s dismissal from the hackerspace in the event of persistent problems.</span></li>

      <h2 class="c14" id="h.dmh2cdy7sktt"><span class="c3">Member-Owned Equipment</span></h2>
      <p class="c9"><span>This section refers specifically to a piece of equipment &ndash; such as a laser cutter, 3D printer, leather-stitcher (i.e. something more than just tools) &ndash; that a member wishes to locate in the space and share with fellow members.
