          <p>801 Labs is a Salt Lake City based hackerspace created by local information technology, electronics, and information security enthusiasts. 801 Labs is a physical space designed to be a center for peer learning and knowledge sharing in the form of workshops, presentations, and lectures. We also offer regular social activities to the community, where people can gather to work on their own projects, exchange ideas, and learn from each other. Since 801 Labs is intended to be a shared community resource, almost all of our events are free and open to the public.</p>

          <h1 id="organization" class="title">Organization</h1>
          <p>801 labs is a non-profit organization run by its volunteers and overseen by a board of directors. Our bylaws are available on our github page, as well as our meeting minutes. The board has the final decision on finances and the direction/vision for the space, but the volunteers are the ones that actually run all the day-to-day activities of the space. Volunteer Committees are responsible for our operations and improvements. A list of those committees can be found on the getting involved page, with descriptions of what each group is responsible for, what they need help with, and who to contact to get involved.</p>
          <p>Our organization is funded entirely by donations. These donations help us pay for our rent to keep the space open and available to the community, as well as allow people and companies to donate equipment to us for our members to use. We accept monetary donations on our donate page, and offer recurring donation options there as well. Donations of equipment for the space to use are handled by our volunteers, who are listed on the getting involved page. These donations are essential for our continued existence, and any donations are welcomed.</p>

          <h1 id="people" class="title">People</h1>
          <p>Our organization is run by volunteers from the general public. The specific people involved are all listed on our getting involved page as members of committees that are responsible for the day-to-day operation of the space. Since many of our members are part of the infosec community, they don’t generally like to provide a lot of personal information online. You’ll notice most of the names of committee members are actually online aliases that they use in place of personally identifying information. If you want to get to know us, the best way to to talk with us on Slack, or to come down to the space for some events and say hello.</p>

      </ul>

      <h3>What is the difference between 801 Labs and DC801?</h3>
      <p>While both are integral parts of the Utah hacker community, 801 Labs and DC801 are separate entities.  801 Labs is the non-profit physical place while DC801 is the people.  Neither have formal membership.  Will I see those people IRL at the place?  Yes, the 801 Labs hackerspace is a [pending] public 501(c)(3) that is open to the public, we welcome everyone.</p>
      <p>DC801 is the local DEFCON user group.  Presentations from DC801 focus on information and general security. For more information on DC801 visit www.dc801.org</p>

      <h3>What is the history of 801 Labs?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2012: DC801 worked with the Utah County hackerspace, The Transistor, to create a sub-branch called TransistorSLC.</li>
        <li>2014: The Transistor closed.</li>
        <li>2014: TransistorSLC rebranded as 801 Labs.</li>
        <li>2014: 801 Labs moved to 353 East 200 South in Salt Lake City, where they have been hacking ever since.</li>
        <li>2019: 801 labs applied for 501(c)(3) to meet the growing demands of the hacker  community.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Is hacking illegal?</h3>
      <p>Ok, this is click bait because everyone defines hacking differently.  Bluntly put, 801 labs does not condone illegal activities.  Leave your black hat at home.  There are too many things that need legal hacking, help us with those instead.</p>
